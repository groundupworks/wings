{"name":"Wings","tagline":"Android library for silently sharing photos to multiple endpoints","body":"Wings is an Android library for silently sharing photos to an extensible set of endpoints. The currently supported endpoints include:\r\n\r\n* Dropbox\r\n* Facebook\r\n* Google Cloud Print\r\n\r\nLinking user accounts, selecting destinations, as well as the retry logic to ensure delivery are all handled by Wings. The application integrates with Wings APIs that are non-specific to the underlying endpoints, and Wings will take care of the rest. Wings also defines an interface for the application to add additional endpoints, so consider the above list easily extensible.\r\n\r\nWings started off as a component in [Flying PhotoBooth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundupworks.flyingphotobooth) and [Party PhotoBooth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundupworks.partyphotobooth), and has helped us publish photos reliably and efficiently over the years. We are now open-sourcing it because posting a photo should be easy, while integrating with native SDKs of the ever-growing number of service providers is anything but easy... so we hope Wings will take care of that part for you, and should you find yourself building new endpoints, make a pull request and add to the list!\r\n\r\n## Adding Wings to your project\r\n\r\nThe Wings library builds multiple artifactsâ€”the core **wings.aar** and an AAR per endpoint, such as **wings-dropbox.aar**. You will only need to include the core library and the endpoints applicable to your application. The recommended way to integrate with Wings is to add the source to your application, but you can also add the AARs instead. The following instructions assume you are building with Gradle in Android Studio.\r\n\r\n### Adding Wings as source\r\n\r\nClone the Wings source.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/groundupworks/wings.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you use [Submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), add Wings as a submodule to your project.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git submodule add https://github.com/groundupworks/wings.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen from your project in Android Studio, **Import Module...** from the root **wings** folder, and you should see the list of all Wings modules. Select **wings** and the endpoints you want your application to share to. Complete the import, and your project's **settings.gradle** should now contain the Wings modules.\r\n\r\nNow you need to add these modules as dependencies in your application's **build.gradle**.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile project(':wings')\r\n    compile project(':wings-dropbox')     // If applicable\r\n    compile project(':wings-facebook')    // If applicable\r\n    compile project(':wings-gcp')         // If applicable\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRebuild your project, and we are done with the build stuff.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
